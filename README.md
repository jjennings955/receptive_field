# Receptive Field Visualizer
Check it out at: https://repl.it/@JasonJennings/EcstaticAcademicBsddaemon

# TODO
* Use svg instead of canvas so we can get the fancy looking skew transforms (probably doable with canvas or other libraries also)
* Grid lines on each canvas
* Construct a different model for each canvas so we can visualize the receptive field starting only at a pixel from that layer
* Arbitrary architectures
