# Receptive Field Visualizer
![](./docs/demo.gif)
Check it out at: https://jjennings955.github.io/receptive_field/

# TODO
* Use svg instead of canvas so we can get the fancy looking skew transforms (probably doable with canvas or other libraries also)
* Grid lines on each canvas
* Construct a different model for each canvas so we can visualize the receptive field starting only at a pixel from that layer
* Arbitrary architectures

I sort of suck at JS/visual design, so if someone would like to make this pretty or more functional, **I'd welcome pull requests.**
